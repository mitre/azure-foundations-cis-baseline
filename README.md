# Azure CIS Benchmark
This InSpec Profile was created to facilitate testing and auditing of `CIS Azure Benchmark`
infrastructure and applications when validating compliancy with [Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
requirements.
 
- Profile Version: **3.0.0**
- Benchmark Date: **2024-09-05**
- Benchmark Version: **3.0.0**
 
 
This profile was developed to reduce the time it takes to perform a security check based upon the
CIS Guidance from the Center for Internet Security (CIS).
 
The CIS Azure Foundation CIS Profile uses the [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec)
open-source compliance validation language to support automation of the required compliance, security
and policy testing for Assessment and Authorization (A&A) and Authority to Operate (ATO) decisions
and Continuous Authority to Operate (cATO) processes.

The Azure CIS Benchmark includes security requirements for a Azure environment.

## Requirements
### Azure Credentials
Your Azure admin may need to be contacted to obtain some of these credentials. The following credentials are needed, as highlighted by the [train-pwsh](https://github.com/mitre/train-pwsh) documentation:
- client_id (id of client)
- tenant_id (id of tenant)
- client_secret (secret key for client)
- certificate_path (path on machine where authentication certificate is stored)
- certificate_password (password for certificate)
- organization (organization domain)
- sharepoint_admin_url (sharepoint url for admin)
- pwsh_path (path on machine where the PowerShell executable is stored)

Some details to create credentials if you are a Azure admin:
- Create an application registration within your account, which will provide you with the appropriate credentials to login such as Client ID and Tenant ID. You will need to create a Client Secret/Certificate as well. The following link provides more detail on how to setup an application registration: [Application_Registration_Steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate)


### Ensure the Following Permissions on your Application Registration Account
  Request your Azure admin for these permissions to Azure modules or enable these permissions if you are the admin:
  - Microsoft Graph
    - SecurityEvents.Read.All
    - User.Read
    - UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All
    - AuditLog.Read.All,
    - Policy.Read.All
  - Office 365 Exchange Online
    - Exchange.ManageAsApp
  - SharePoint
    - Sites.FullControl.All

### Required software and steps needed on the InSpec Runner
- git
- [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4)
- [InSpec](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-inspec/)
- [train-pwsh](https://github.com/mitre/train-pwsh)
- [inspec-pwsh](https://github.com/mitre/inspec-pwsh)

Inspec, train-pwsh, inspec-pwsh are already included as gems in this profile and should not need separate downloads. The profile just needs to be ran with bundle exec to ensure the gems are loaded.  

It is also important to follow/understand the documentation for train-pwsh and inspec-pwsh that is linked above for this profile to run correctly. For context, the train-pwsh is the transport that is used to maintain a persistent connection with various PowerShell sessions. Meanwhile, inspec-pwsh is a resource pack that is used to connect controls using different modules to its corresponding session group (e.g. session for exchange, teams, exchange/graph, etc.). The documentation for inspec-pwsh has more detail about the resource pack. 

Additionally, for train-pwsh, the organization field will also need to be defined as a environment variable named `ORGANIZATION` as it is used in a profile. The train-pwsh documentation has more detail on how to create this environment variable. Additionally, it is important to note that train-pwsh is not being invoked using code in this profile, so the config.json file approach needs to be followed for train to run correctly. The documentation for train-pwsh goes into more detail on how to create the config.json and  populate its contents with your Azure credentials that are used by this profile. 

### PowerShell Module Installation
Ensure access and install the following PowerShell modules. The controls also have the module installation code when running the PowerShell queries for redundancy purposes:
- [Microsoft.Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation?view=graph-powershell-1.0#installation)
- [ExchangeOnlineManagement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps)
- [PnP.PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets)
- [MicrosoftTeams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-install)

### Test O365 Example

Upon obtaining the right permissions/credentials and downloading the correct modules/software, test that these permissions work by running the o365_example_baseline profile available at the following link: [O365 Profile](https://github.com/mitre/o365_example_baseline). If the o365 profile runs correctly, then this profile should be able to ran correctly. The o365_example_baseline profile contains a subset of controls from this profile, and also leverages `train-pwsh` and `inspec-pwsh`. It should serve as a good test to ensure that `train-pwsh` and `inspec-pwsh` are working properly. 

More details on how to use `train-pwsh` and `inspec-pwsh` are detailed below:

- [train-pwsh](https://github.com/mitre/train-pwsh)
- [inspec-pwsh](https://github.com/mitre/inspec-pwsh)

## Getting Started  
### InSpec (CINC Auditor) setup
For maximum flexibility/accessibility, CINC Auditor (`cinc-auditor`) is the executable program that should be used to run this testing profile.

CINC Auditor is the open-source packaged binary version of Chef InSpec,
compiled by the CINC (CINC Is Not Chef) project in coordination with Chef using Chef's always-open-source InSpec source code. CINC Auditor and InSpec are built from the same source code and function identically, but CINC Auditor requires no license to use (which means it also does not come with any expectation of support from Chef).

For more information see [CINC Home](https://cinc.sh/)
 
It is intended and recommended that CINC Auditor and this profile executed from a __"runner"__ host
(such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop)
against the target. This can be any Unix/Linux/MacOS or Windows runner host, with access to the Internet.
 
> [!TIP]
> **For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the latest version of CINC Auditor and any other supporting language components.**
 
To install CINC Auditor on a UNIX/Linux/MacOS platform use the following command:
```bash
curl -L https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P cinc-auditor
```
 
To install CINC Auditor on a Windows platform (PowerShell) use the following command:
```powershell
. { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.ps1 } | iex; install -project cinc-auditor
```
 
To confirm successful install of CINC Auditor:
```
cinc-auditor -v
```
 
Latest versions and other installation options are available at [CINC Auditor](https://cinc.sh/start/auditor/)'s website.
 
[top](#table-of-contents)
### Intended Usage
1. The latest `released` version of the profile is intended for use in A&A testing, as well as
    providing formal results to Authorizing Officials and Identity and Access Management (IAM)s.
    Please use the `released` versions of the profile in these types of workflows.
 
2. The `main` branch is a development branch that will become the next release of the profile.
    The `main` branch is intended for use in _developing and testing_ merge requests for the next
    release of the profile, and _is not intended_ be used for formal and ongoing testing on systems.
 
[top](#table-of-contents)
### Tailoring to Your Environment
This profile uses InSpec Inputs to provide flexibility during testing. Inputs allow for
customizing the behavior of Chef InSpec profiles.
 
InSpec Inputs are defined in the `inspec.yml` file. The `inputs` configured in this
file are **profile definitions and defaults for the profile** extracted from the profile
guidances and contain metadata that describe the profile, and shouldn't be modified.
 
InSpec provides several methods for customizing profile behaviors at run-time that does not require
modifying the `inspec.yml` file itself (see [Using Customized Inputs](#using-customized-inputs)).
 
The following inputs are permitted to be configured in an inputs `.yml` file (often named inputs.yml)
for the profile to run correctly on a specific environment, while still complying with the security
guidance document intent. This is important to prevent confusion when test results are passed downstream
to different stakeholders under the *security guidance name used by this profile repository*
 
For changes beyond the inputs cited in this section, users can create an *organizationally-named overlay repository*.
For more information on developing overlays, reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre-saf-training.netlify.app/courses/beginner/10.html)
 
#### Example of tailoring Inputs *While Still Complying* with the security guidance document for the profile:
 
```yaml
```
 
> [!NOTE]
>Inputs are variables that are referenced by control(s) in the profile that implement them.
 They are declared (defined) and given a default value in the `inspec.yml` file.
 
#### Using Customized Inputs
Customized inputs may be used at the CLI by providing an input file or a flag at execution time.
 
1. Using the `--input` flag
 
    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input disable_slow_controls=true`
 
2. Using the `--input-file` flag.
   
    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input-file=<my_inputs_file.yml>`
 
>[!TIP]
> For additional information about `input` file examples reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre.github.io/saf-training/courses/beginner/06.html#input-file-example)

### Testing the Profile Controls
The Gemfile provided contains all the necessary ruby dependencies for checking the profile controls.
#### Requirements
All action are conducted using `ruby` (gemstone/programming language). Currently `inspec`
commands have been tested with ruby version 3.1.2. A higher version of ruby is not guaranteed to
provide the expected results. Any modern distribution of Ruby comes with Bundler preinstalled by default.
 
Install ruby based on the OS being used, see [Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
 
After installing `ruby` install the necessary dependencies by invoking the bundler command
(must be in the same directory where the Gemfile is located):
```bash
bundle install
```
 
#### Testing Commands
 
Linting and validating controls:
```bash
  bundle exec rake [inspec or cinc-auditor]:check # Validate the InSpec Profile
  bundle exec rake lint                            # Run RuboCop Linter
  bundle exec rake lint:auto_correct       # Autocorrect RuboCop offenses (only when it's safe)
  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks  # Pre-commit checks
```
 
Ensure the controls are ready to be committed into the repo:
```bash
  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks
```
 
 
[top](#table-of-contents)
## Running the Profile
**Note**: Replace the profile's directory name - e.g. - `<Profile>` with `.` if currently in the profile's root directory.
**Note 2**: The `<Name of Dictionary Storing Pwsh Options>` will be `pwsh-options` if exactly following train-pwsh documentation.
```sh
bundle exec cinc-auditor exec <Profile> -t pwsh://<Name of Dictionary Storing Pwsh Options> --controls=<control_id> --enhanced-outcomes --input-file=inputs.yml
```

#### Execute a Single Control and save results as JSON 
```sh
bundle exec cinc-auditor exec <Profile> -t pwsh://<Name of Dictionary Storing Pwsh Options>> --controls=<control_id> --enhanced-outcomes --input-file=inputs.yml --reporter json:results.json
```

#### Execute All Controls in the Profile 
```sh
bundle exec cinc-auditor exec <Profile> -t pwsh://<Name of Dictionary Storing Pwsh Options>> --enhanced-outcomes --input-file=inputs.yml
```

#### Execute all the Controls in the Profile and save results as JSON 
```sh
bundle exec cinc-auditor exec <Profile> -t pwsh://<Name of Dictionary Storing Pwsh Options>> --enhanced-outcomes --input-file=inputs.yml --reporter json:results.json
```

## Using Heimdall for Viewing Test Results
The JSON results output file can be loaded into **[Heimdall-Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)**
or **[Heimdall-Server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)** for a user-interactive, graphical view of the profile scan results.
 
Heimdall-Lite is a `browser only` viewer that allows you to easily view your results directly and locally rendered in your browser.
Heimdall-Server is configured with a `data-services backend` allowing for data persistency to a database (PostgreSQL).
For more detail on feature capabilities see [Heimdall Features](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2?tab=readme-ov-file#features)
 
Heimdall can **_export your results into a DISA Checklist (CKL) file_** for easily uploading into eMass using the `Heimdall Export` function.
 
Depending on your environment restrictions, the [SAF CLI](https://saf-cli.mitre.org) can be used to run a local docker instance
of Heimdall-Lite via the `saf view:heimdall` command.
 
Additionally both Heimdall applications can be deployed via docker, kubernetes, or the installation packages.
