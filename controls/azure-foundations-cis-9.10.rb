       "Newer versions may contain security enhancements and additional functionality. Using the latest version is recommended in order to take advantage of enhancements and new capabilities. With each software installation, organizations need to determine if a given update meets their requirements. They must also verify the compatibility and support provided for any additional software against the update revision that is selected.
        HTTP 2.0 has additional performance improvements on the head-of-line blocking problem of old HTTP version, header compression, and prioritization of requests. HTTP 2.0 no longer supports HTTP 1.1's chunked transfer encoding mechanism, as it provides its own, more efficient, mechanisms for data streaming."

        Audit from Azure CLI
            To check HTTP 2.0 version status for an existing app, run the following command,
                az webapp config show --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> --query http20Enabled
            The output should return true if HTTPS 2.0 traffic value is set to On.
        Audit from PowerShell
            For each application, run the following command:
                Get-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <app resource group> -Name <app name> |Select-Object -ExpandProperty SiteConfig
            If the value of the Http20Enabled setting is true, the application is compliant. Otherwise if the value of the Http20Enabled setting is false, the application is non-compliant.
