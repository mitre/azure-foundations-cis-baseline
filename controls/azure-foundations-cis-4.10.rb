        personal. Data that is erroneously modified or deleted by an application or other storage
        account user will cause data loss or unavailability.
        It is recommended that both Azure Containers with attached Blob Storage and
        standalone containers with Blob Storage be made recoverable by enabling the soft
        delete configuration. This is to save and recover data when blobs or blob snapshots are
        deleted."

        user may do this deliberately in order to cause disruption. Deleting an Azure Storage
        blob causes immediate data loss. Enabling this configuration for Azure storage ensures
        that even if blobs/data were deleted from the storage account, Blobs/data objects are
        recoverable for a particular time which is set in the 'Retention policies,'' ranging from 7
        days to 365 days."
