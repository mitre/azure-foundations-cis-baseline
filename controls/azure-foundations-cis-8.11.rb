  title 'Ensure Trusted Launch is enabled on Virtual Machines'
  desc 'When Secure Boot and vTPM are enabled together, they provide a strong foundation for protecting your VM from boot attacks. For example, if an attacker attempts to replace the bootloader with a malicious version, Secure Boot will prevent the VM from booting. If the attacker is able to bypass Secure Boot and install a malicious bootloader, vTPM can be used to detect the intrusion and alert you.'

  desc 'rationale',
       'Secure Boot and vTPM work together to protect your VM from a variety of boot attacks, including bootkits, rootkits, and firmware rootkits. Not enabling Trusted Launch in Azure VM can lead to increased vulnerability to rootkits and boot-level malware, reduced ability to detect and prevent unauthorized changes to the boot process, and a potential compromise of system integrity and data security.'

  desc 'impact',
       'Secure Boot and vTPM are not currently supported for Azure Generation 1 VMs.
      IMPORTANT: Before enabling Secure Boot and vTPM on a Generation 2 VM which does not already have both enabled, it is highly recommended to create a restore point of the VM prior to remediation.'
