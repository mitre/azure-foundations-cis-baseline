       "Azure Key Vault enables users to store and use cryptographic keys within the Microsoft
        Azure environment. The exp (expiration date) attribute identifies the expiration date on
        or after which the key MUST NOT be used for a cryptographic operation. By default,
        keys never expire. It is thus recommended that keys be rotated in the key vault and set
        an explicit expiration date for all keys. This ensures that the keys cannot be used
        beyond their assigned lifetimes"

        1. Go to Key vaults.
        2. For each Key vault, click on Keys.
        3. In the main pane, ensure that an appropriate Expiration date is set for any
        keys that are Enabled.
        Audit from Azure CLI
        Get a list of all the key vaults in your Azure environment by running the following
        command:
        az keyvault list
        Then for each key vault listed ensure that the output of the below command contains
        Key ID (kid), enabled status as true and Expiration date (expires) is not empty or null:
        az keyvault key list --vault-name <VaultName> --query
        '[*].{'kid':kid,'enabled':attributes.enabled,'expires':attributes.expires}'
        Audit from PowerShell
        Retrieve a list of Azure Key vaults:
        Get-AzKeyVault
        For each Key vault run the following command to determine which vaults are configured
        to use RBAC.
        Get-AzKeyVault -VaultName <VaultName>
        For each Key vault with the EnableRbacAuthorizatoin setting set to True, run the
        following command.
        Get-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName <VaultName>
        Make sure the Expires setting is configured with a value as appropriate wherever the
        Enabled setting is set to True.

        To update the expiration date for the keys:
        1. Go to the Key vault, click on Access Control (IAM).
        2. Click on Add role assignment and assign the role of Key Vault Crypto Officer to
        the appropriate user.
