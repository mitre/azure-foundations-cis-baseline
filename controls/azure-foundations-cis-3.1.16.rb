        can continue to use the service, but new subscribers will receive alerts about suspicious
        DNS activity as part of Defender for Servers P2.]
        Microsoft Defender for DNS scans all network traffic exiting from within a subscription."

    desc 'rationale',
        "DNS lookups within a subscription are scanned and compared to a dynamic list of
        websites that might be potential security threats. These threats could be a result of a
        security breach within your services, thus scanning for them could prevent a potential
        security threat from being introduced."

        "Enabling Microsoft Defender for DNS requires enabling Microsoft Defender for your
        subscription. Both will incur additional charges, with Defender for DNS being a small
        amount per million queries."
