        environment. Secrets in the Azure Key Vault are octet sequences with a maximum size
        of 25k bytes each. The exp (expiration date) attribute identifies the expiration date on or
        after which the secret MUST NOT be used. By default, secrets never expire. It is thus
        recommended to rotate secrets in the key vault and set an explicit expiration date for all
        secrets. This ensures that the secrets cannot be used beyond their assigned lifetimes."

        1. Go to Key vaults.
        2. For each Key vault, click on Secrets.
        3. In the main pane, ensure that the status of the secret is Enabled.
        4. For each enabled secret, ensure that an appropriate Expiration date is set.
        Audit from Azure CLI
        Ensure that the output of the below command contains ID (id), enabled status as true
        and Expiration date (expires) is not empty or null:
        az keyvault secret list --vault-name <KEYVAULTNAME> --query
        '[*].{'kid':kid,'enabled':attributes.enabled,'expires':attributes.expires}'
        Audit from PowerShell
        Retrieve a list of Key vaults:
        Get-AzKeyVault
        For each Key vault, run the following command to determine which vaults are
        configured to use RBAC:
        Get-AzKeyVault -VaultName <Vault Name>
        For each Key vault with the EnableRbacAuthorization setting set to True, run the
        following command:
        Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName <Vault Name>
        Make sure the Expires setting is configured with a value as appropriate wherever the
        Enabled setting is set to True.
