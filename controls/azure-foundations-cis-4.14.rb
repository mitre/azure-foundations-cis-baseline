  title "Ensure Storage Logging is Enabled for Table Service for 'Read', 'Write', and 'Delete' Requests"
  desc "Azure Table storage is a service that stores structured NoSQL data in the cloud,
        providing a key/attribute store with a schema-less design. Storage Logging happens
        server-side and allows details for both successful and failed requests to be recorded in
        the storage account. These logs allow users to see the details of read, write, and delete
        operations against the tables. Storage Logging log entries contain the following
        information about individual requests: timing information such as start time, end-to-end
        latency, and server latency; authentication details; concurrency information; and the
        sizes of the request and response messages."

  desc 'rationale',
       "Storage Analytics logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests
        to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor each individual request to
        a storage service for increased security or diagnostics. Requests are logged on a best-
        effort basis.
        Storage Analytics logging is not enabled by default for your storage account."

  desc 'impact',
       "Being a level 2, enabling this setting can have a high impact on the cost of data storage
        used for logging more data per each request. Do not enable this without determining
        your need for this level of logging or forget to check in on data usage and projected
        cost."
