       "Disabling remote debugging on Azure App Service is primarily about enhancing security.
        Remote debugging opens a communication channel that can be exploited by attackers. By disabling it, you reduce the number of potential entry points for unauthorized access.
        If remote debugging is enabled without proper access controls, it can allow unauthorized users to connect to your application, potentially leading to data breaches or malicious code execution.
        During a remote debugging session, sensitive information might be exposed. Disabling remote debugging helps ensure that such data remains secure. This minimizes the use of remote access tools to reduce risk.control 'azure-foundations-cis-9.12' do"

       'You will not be able to connect to your application from a remote location to diagnose and fix issues in real-time. You will not be able to step through code, set breakpoints, or inspect variables and the call stack while the application is running on the server. Remote debugging is particularly useful for diagnosing issues that only occur in the production environment. Without it, you will need to rely on logs and other diagnostic tools.'

          1. Login to Azure Portal using https://portal.azure.com
          2. Go to App Services
          3. Click on each App
          4. Under Setting section, Click on Configuration
          5. Under the General settings tab, check the Remote debugging option. Ensure it is set to Off.
        Audit from Azure CLI
          To check remote debugging status for an existing app, run the following command,
            az webapp config show --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <app_name> --query remoteDebuggingEnabled
          The output should be false if remote debugging is disabled.
        Audit From Powershell
          To check remote debugging status for an existing app, run the following command,
            Get-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name> -Name <app_name> |Select-Object -ExpandProperty SiteConfig
          The output of remoteDebuggingEnabled should be false if remote debugging is disabled.
