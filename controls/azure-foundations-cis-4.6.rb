    desc "Disallowing public network access for a storage account overrides the public access
        settings for individual containers in that storage account for Azure Resource Manager
        Deployment Model storage accounts. Azure Storage accounts that use the classic
        deployment model will be retired on August 31, 2024."

    desc 'rationale',
        "The default network configuration for a storage account permits a user with appropriate
        permissions to configure public network access to containers and blobs in a storage
        account. Keep in mind that public access to a container is always turned off by default
        and must be explicitly configured to permit anonymous requests. It grants read-only
        access to these resources without sharing the account key, and without requiring a
        shared access signature. It is recommended not to provide public network access to
        storage accounts until, and unless, it is strongly desired. A shared access signature
        token or Azure AD RBAC should be used for providing controlled and timed access to
        blob containers."
