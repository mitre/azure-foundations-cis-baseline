    desc "Some Azure services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that
        can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as
        intended, allow the set of trusted Azure services to bypass the network rules. These
        services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account. If the Allow
        trusted Azure services exception is enabled, the following services are granted access
        to the storage account: Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, Azure DevTest Labs,
        Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Networking, Azure Monitor, and Azure SQL
        Data Warehouse (when registered in the subscription)."

        "Turning on firewall rules for storage account will block access to incoming requests for
        data, including from other Azure services. We can re-enable this functionality by
        enabling 'Trusted Azure Services' through networking exceptions."

       "This creates authentication credentials for services that need access to storage
        resources so that services will no longer need to communicate via network request.
        There may be a temporary loss of communication as you set each Storage Account. It
        is recommended to not do this on mission-critical resources during business hours."
