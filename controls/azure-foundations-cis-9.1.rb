  desc 'Azure App Service allows apps to run under both HTTP and HTTPS by default. Apps can be accessed by anyone using non-secure HTTP links by default. Non-secure HTTP requests can be restricted and all HTTP requests redirected to the secure HTTPS port. It is recommended to enforce HTTPS-only traffic.'

  desc 'rationale',
       'Enabling HTTPS-only traffic will redirect all non-secure HTTP requests to HTTPS ports. HTTPS uses the TLS/SSL protocol to provide a secure connection which is both encrypted and authenticated. It is therefore important to support HTTPS for the security benefits.'

        Audit from Azure CLI
            To check HTTPS-only traffic value for an existing app, run the following command,
                az webapp show --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> --query httpsOnly
            The output should return true if HTTPS-only traffic value is set to On.
