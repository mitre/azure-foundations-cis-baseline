    title "Ensure 'Cross Tenant Replication' is not enabled"
    desc "Cross Tenant Replication in Azure allows data to be replicated across multiple Azure
        tenants. While this feature can be beneficial for data sharing and availability, it also
        poses a significant security risk if not properly managed. Unauthorized data access,
        data leakage, and compliance violations are potential risks. Disabling Cross Tenant
        Replication ensures that data is not inadvertently replicated across different tenant
        boundaries without explicit authorization."

    desc 'rationale',
        "Disabling Cross Tenant Replication minimizes the risk of unauthorized data access and
        ensures that data governance policies are strictly adhered to. This control is especially
        critical for organizations with stringent data security and privacy requirements, as it
        prevents the accidental sharing of sensitive information."

    desc 'impact',
        "Disabling Cross Tenant Replication may affect data availability and sharing across
        different Azure tenants. Ensure that this change aligns with your organizational data
        sharing and availability requirements."
