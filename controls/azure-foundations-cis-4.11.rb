  desc "Enable sensitive data encryption at rest using Customer Managed Keys (CMK) rather
        than Microsoft Managed keys."

  desc 'rationale',
       "By default, data in the storage account is encrypted using Microsoft Managed Keys at
        rest. All Azure Storage resources are encrypted, including blobs, disks, files, queues,
        and tables. All object metadata is also encrypted. If you want to control and manage this
        encryption key yourself, however, you can specify a customer-managed key. That key is
        used to protect and control access to the key that encrypts your data. You can also
        choose to automatically update the key version used for Azure Storage encryption
        whenever a new version is available in the associated Key Vault.
        While it is possible to automate the assessment of this recommendation, the
        assessment status for this recommendation remains 'Manual.' This is because the
        recommendation pertains to storage accounts that store critical data and is therefore not
        applicable to all storage accounts."

  desc 'impact',
       "If the key expires by setting the 'activation date' and 'expiration date', the user must
        rotate the key manually.
        Using Customer Managed Keys may also incur additional man-hour requirements to
        create, store, manage, and protect the keys as needed."
