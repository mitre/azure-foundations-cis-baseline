        rest. All Azure Storage resources are encrypted, including blobs, disks, files, queues,
        and tables. All object metadata is also encrypted. If you want to control and manage this
        encryption key yourself, however, you can specify a customer-managed key. That key is
        used to protect and control access to the key that encrypts your data. You can also
        choose to automatically update the key version used for Azure Storage encryption
        whenever a new version is available in the associated Key Vault."

        create, store, manage, and protect the keys as needed."
