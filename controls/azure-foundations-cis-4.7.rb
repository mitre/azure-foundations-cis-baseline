  title 'Ensure Default Network Access Rule for Storage Accounts is Set to Deny'
  desc "Restricting default network access helps to provide a new layer of security, since
        storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. To limit access to
        selected networks, the default action must be changed."

  desc 'rationale',
       "Storage accounts should be configured to deny access to traffic from all networks
        (including internet traffic). Access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure Virtual
        networks, allowing a secure network boundary for specific applications to be built.
        Access can also be granted to public internet IP address ranges to enable connections
        from specific internet or on-premises clients. When network rules are configured, only
        applications from allowed networks can access a storage account. When calling from an
        allowed network, applications continue to require proper authorization (a valid access
        key or SAS token) to access the storage account."

  desc 'impact',
       "All allowed networks will need to be whitelisted on each specific network, creating
        administrative overhead. This may result in loss of network connectivity, so do not turn
        on for critical resources during business hours."
