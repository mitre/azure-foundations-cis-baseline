  desc 'rationale',
       "Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate
        forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides
        additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to
        be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two
        different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus
        reducing the risk."

        1. From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
        2. Select the Microsoft Entra ID blade
        3. Under Manage, click Users
        4. Click the Per-User MFA button on the top bar
        For every user listed, ensure that the Status column indicates Enabled
        Audit from REST API
        For Every Subscription, For Every Tenant
        Step 1: Identify Users with non-administrative Access
        1. List All Users Using Microsoft Graph API:
        GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users
        Capture id and corresponding userPrincipalName ($uid, $userPrincipalName)
        2. List all Role Definitions Using Azure management API:
        https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/providers/Microso
        ft.Authorization/roleDefinitions?api-version=2017-05-01
        Capture Role Definition IDs/Name ($name) and role names ($properties/roleName)
        where 'properties/roleName' does NOT contain (Owner or *contributor or admin
        )
        3. List All Role Assignments (Mappings $A.uid to $B.name) Using Azure
        Management API:
        GET
        https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/providers/Microso
        ft.Authorization/roleassignments?api-version=2017-10-01-preview
        Find all non-administrative roles ($B.name) in 'Properties/roleDefinationId'
        mapped with user ids ($A.id) in 'Properties/principalId' where
        'Properties/principalType' == 'User'
        D> Now Match ($CProperties/principalId) with $A.uid and get
        $A.userPrincipalName save this as D.userPrincipleName
        Step 2: Run Graph PowerShell command:
        get-mguser -All | where {$_.StrongAuthenticationMethods.Count -eq 0} |
        Select-Object -Property UserPrincipalName
        If the output contains any of the $D.userPrincipleName, then this recommendation is
        non-compliant.
        Audit from Azure Policy
        If referencing a digital copy of this Benchmark, clicking a Policy ID will open a link to the
        associated Policy definition in Azure.
        If referencing a printed copy, you can search Policy IDs from this URL:
