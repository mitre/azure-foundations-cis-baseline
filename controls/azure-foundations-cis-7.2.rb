        "The potential security problem with using SSH over the Internet is that attackers can use various brute force techniques to gain access to Azure Virtual Machines. Once the attackers gain access, they can use a virtual machine as a launch point for compromising other machines on the Azure Virtual Network or even attack networked devices outside of Azure."

       %(Audit from Azure Portal
            1. Open the Networking blade for the specific Virtual machine in Azure portal
            2. Verify that the INBOUND PORT RULES does not have a rule for SSH such as
                o port = 22,
                o protocol = TCP OR ANY,
                o Source = Any OR Internet
        Audit from Azure CLI 
            List Network security groups with corresponding non-default Security rules: 
                az network nsg list --query [*].[name,securityRules]
            Ensure that none of the NSGs have security rule as below 
                "access" : "Allow" 
                "destinationPortRange" : "22" or "*" or "[port range containing 22]" 
                "direction" : "Inbound" 
                "protocol" : "TCP" or "*" "sourceAddressPrefix" : "*" or "0.0.0.0" or "<nw>/0" or "/0" or "internet" or "any"
